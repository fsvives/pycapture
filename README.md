# pycapture

This tool is created to automate multiple screen captures requiring some keyboard/mouse interaction between captures. 

The pycatpure.py contains an example where for every capture a page down is required, as if a very long web page was being captured. Looking at the key/mouse codes in the sendkey modules, more complex combinations and screen capture automation can be achieved to achieve the desired effect.
