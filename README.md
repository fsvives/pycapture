# pycapture

This tool is created to automate multiple and timed screen captures requiring some human interaction between captures. 

The pycatpure.py contains an example where for every capture a page down is required. Looking at the key/mouse codes in the sendkey modules, more complex combinations can bre created to achieve the desired effect.
